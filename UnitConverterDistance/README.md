Unit Converter App

This is my first app made using kotlin and compose. My main motive to build this app was to understand the basic features of the UI of android development.

I have learned various things in the app provided with compose like:-

1. Working with text in compose.
2. Using Composable functions.
3. Using boxes, rows, and columns.
4. Working with text fields.
5. Using buttons and drop down menus.
6. Using basic logic using the kotlin language.
7. Understanding variable states in android development.

App structure and working.

I have created the whole app in the form of a column which consists of different rows. There are two drop down menus out of which one is for the input unit and the other is for the output unit.

The input is taken from the text field and is displayed as text.

The buttons can be used to toggle to show and hide the dropdown menus.
