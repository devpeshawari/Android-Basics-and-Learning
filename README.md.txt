I have created this repository to showcase and track my learning in app development by primarily using kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

I am a beginner in app development and this repository will contain projects starting from basic level to higher levels. I will first work to create UI's and will be projects inspired from tutorials. I will progressively work towards integrating backend systems in my apps, and finally developing a full fledged app consisting of original ideas, beautiful UI and creativity.
